About Roger

Who Am I?
--

My name is Roger Lipscombe. I'm 37 years old, and I live in West London. I work for Trayport, in London. I've been at Trayport for about 3 years, since April 2010. Before that, I was at 1E for just over 5 years.

I went to the [University of Warwick](http://warwick.ac.uk/), between 1994 and 1997, studying [Computer Science](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/).

Summary
--

Over 15 years' commercial development experience, mostly on Windows. Several senior developer roles, including development lead and most recently technical software architect. Experienced with Agile processes, including XP and Scrum.

I'm an extremely experienced Windows developer, with C++ and the Win32 API, and with C# and the .NET framework. I also have a lot of experience with SQL Server.

I'm good at acquiring new skills extremely quickly, and I like keeping my skills up to date. I tend to investigate a new technology by working on small projects in my spare time. At the moment, I’m learning node.js (Javascript) and MongoDB by reimplementing [my blog](http://blog.differentpla.net/).

But, I'm not just a coder. I'm good at general trouble-shooting. For example: I can drive a network packet sniffer, and I understand a bunch of different network protocols.

I'm also good at communicating what I've learnt to other team members, through demonstrations, presentations, mentoring and just being around to answer questions and help out. I participate in code reviews, and the recruitment process.

I'm also willing to step up and take various other roles as needed. For example, I've spent time as scrum master, and have worked with product management to define and scope releases. I'm also willing to help out other teams as needed.

Hobbies

###Snowboarding###

I try to go at least once a year; I’ve been to both to Europe and North America. I’m on a K2 Nemesis, riding regular. Most recently, I went to Les Arcs with a group of friends and spent a lot of my time following a guide around in superb off-piste conditions.

I’m lousy at jumps and once had to have staples put in a head wound. I now wear a helmet.
