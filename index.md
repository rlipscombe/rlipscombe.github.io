# About Roger

## Who Am I?

My name is Roger Lipscombe. I live in West London.

I currently work at [Happening](https://happening.xyz) (the technology powering Superbet), as a Senior Software
Engineer. I've been at Happening since October 2022.

Prior to that, I was tech lead of the "Microvisor Cloud" development team -- part of the IoT business unit -- at
[Twilio](https://twilio.com). I was at Twilio for a little over two years, from when they acquired
[Electric Imp](https://electricimp.com). I started at Electric Imp about 12 years ago.

Before joining Electric Imp, I was a Software Architect at [Trayport](http://trayport.com), in London. I was at Trayport
for a little over 3 years, from April 2010 until August 2013.  Before *that*, I was at [1E](http://1e.com) for just over
5 years. If you want to go back further, check out my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rlipscombe).

I went to the [University of Warwick](http://warwick.ac.uk/), between 1994 and 1997, where I received a BSc (Hons) in
[Computer Science](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/).

## Professional Summary

Almost 35 years' commercial development experience.

Several senior developer roles, including development lead and most recently technical software architect. I've spent
some time as an Engineering Manager.

Experienced with Agile processes, including XP and Scrum.

I've been using Erlang and Elixir for the last 12 years, successfully building and operating Electric Imp's cloud
components at scale, and with excellent reliability. At the moment, I'm applying those same skills at Happening, at a
larger scale.

I'm also an experienced Windows developer, with C++ and the Win32 API, and with C# and the .NET framework. I also have a
lot of experience with SQL Server.

I'm good at acquiring new skills extremely quickly, and I like keeping my skills up to date. I tend to investigate a new
technology by working on small projects in my spare time. I learned more about Kubernetes using my home lab. At the moment,
I'm learning Rust.

But I'm not just a coder. I'm good at general trouble-shooting. For example: I can drive a network packet sniffer, and I
understand a bunch of different network protocols.

I'm good at communicating what I've learnt to other team members, through demonstrations, presentations, mentoring and
just being around to answer questions and help out.  I'm also willing to help out other teams as needed. I participate
in code reviews. I'm often part of the recruitment process.

I'm also willing to step up and take various other roles as needed. For example, I've spent time as scrum master, and
have worked with product management to define and scope releases, and face-to-face with customers to capture
requirements, and to perform hand-over training.

## Hobbies

### Snowboarding

I haven't been since before COVID-19, but prior to that I rode in both Europe and North America. I’m on a K2 Nemesis,
riding regular.

I’m lousy at jumps and once had to have staples put in a head wound. I now wear a helmet.
