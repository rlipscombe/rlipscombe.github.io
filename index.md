Who Am I?
--

My name is Roger Lipscombe. I'm 37 years old, and I live in West London. I work for Trayport, in London. I've been at Trayport for about 3 years, since April 2010. Before that, I was at 1E for just over 5 years.

I went to the University of Warwick, between 1994 and 1997, studying Computer Science.

I've been married to Jenni since June 2006. Our first child, Charlie, was born in May 2008. Our second child, Alice, was born at the end of March 2010.
