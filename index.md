# About Roger

## Who Am I?

My name is Roger Lipscombe. I'm 44 years old, and I live in West London.  I
lead the "core cloud services" team at [Electric Imp](https://electricimp.com)
in the UK.

Before joining Electric Imp, I was a Software Architect at
[Trayport](http://trayport.com), in London. I was at Trayport for a little over
3 years, from April 2010 until August 2013.  Before *that*, I was at
[1E](http://1e.com) for just over 5 years. If you want to go back further,
check out my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rlipscombe).

I went to the [University of Warwick](http://warwick.ac.uk/), between 1994 and
1997, where I received a BSc (Hons) in [Computer Science](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/).

## Professional Summary

Over 20 years' commercial development experience, mostly on Windows. Several
senior developer roles, including development lead and most recently technical
software architect. Experienced with Agile processes, including XP and Scrum.

I'm an extremely experienced Windows developer, with C++ and the Win32 API, and
with C# and the .NET framework. I also have a lot of experience with SQL
Server.

Since 2013, I've been programming in node.js, Erlang and C++ on Linux.

I'm good at acquiring new skills extremely quickly, and I like keeping my
skills up to date. I tend to investigate a new technology by working on small
projects in my spare time.

But I'm not just a coder. I'm good at general trouble-shooting. For example: I
can drive a network packet sniffer, and I understand a bunch of different
network protocols.

I'm also good at communicating what I've learnt to other team members, through
demonstrations, presentations, mentoring and just being around to answer
questions and help out.  I'm also willing to help out other teams as needed. I
participate in code reviews, and the recruitment process.

I'm also willing to step up and take various other roles as needed. For
example, I've spent time as scrum master, and have worked with product
management to define and scope releases, and face-to-face with customers to
capture requirements.

## Hobbies

### Snowboarding

I try to go at least once a year; I’ve been to both Europe and North America.
I’m on a K2 Nemesis, riding regular.

I’m lousy at jumps and once had to have staples put in a head wound. I now wear
a helmet.
